#Overview
[end]

The National STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) Consortium, organized by Anne Arundel Community College in Maryland, is a case study in how freely available, high quality open educational resources help resource-challenged educational institutions keep pace with the rapidly evolving demands of students, job-seekers, and employers looking for skilled workers. Even more importantly, the Consortium, which is barely three years old, is also a window into the future of workforce training, higher education and skills development.

“The greatest benefit,” explains Brian Bosworth, the president of FutureWorks, an economic and workforce development consulting firm, and adviser to the Consortium, “is the idea of ten colleges across nine states actually working together to build nationally relevant and nationally portable curriculum.” The Consortium’s shared effort was initiated by ten founding community colleges in Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, and Washington, in addition to Maryland. The collaboration exemplifies what innovative academic leaders can accomplish through the use of open licenses and readily available tools and technologies that build shared intellectual capital for mutual benefit.

In that sense, the educators leading this effort are doing more than just building curricula they can all freely use, as important as that is to instructors, schools and students. They are also creating a new approach to teaching and learning for their schools that operates much more like the fast moving competitive industries their students hope to join.

#Collaboration
[end]

The level of collaboration and cooperation across borders and instructional disciplines currently underway is unprecedented, according to Consortium members. And it has already created some big wins. For starters, the advent of the Consortium enabled educators in different labor markets to identify common instructional needs and combine their efforts to develop and continuously improve shared learning resources that match their requirements.

These shared open learning resources lay a common academic foundation for whatever each individual school or learner wants to do next, whether it is rapid job placement or more advanced studies. “We’re demonstrating how to work collaboratively across lots of colleges to meet the needs of those colleges and lots of other colleges as well,” notes Bosworth.

#Open Curriculum
[end]

The Department of Labor’s TAACCCT grant program requires the use of an open license on all new intellectual property created with federal funds. As a result, the Consortium’s open, shared STEM curriculum redirects scarce community college funds away from a reliance on antiquated methods, such as requiring students to purchase textbooks or similar commercial online materials, and toward the development of online, often printable on demand curricula that instructors can customize, which in turn promotes more instructor engagement and deeper student learning.

Open educational resources facilitate this process, participants say, by allowing instructors to organize -- or in the case of many STEM programs with often disappointingly high failure rates -- reorganize courses and programs in ways that better help students build the confident mastery of STEM skills that is required to earn educational certificates prized by employers."

#Focusing on the student
[end]

The National STEM Consortium’s flexible, student-centered approach cuts the costs imposed on students through the use of open educational resources, and breaks down other barriers to student success as well. One hallmark is the Consortium’s STEM Bridge Strategy, which embeds competency-based, targeted STEM instruction directly into the core technical curriculum being studied to enable students to get the STEM skills development help they need when they need it. This “contextualized” approach to STEM instruction is an alternative to the traditional method, which usually requires students to first attend non-credit bearing developmental courses that all too often serve as a graveyard for academic ambitions. Instead, students whose studies incorporate one of the first five National STEM   Consortium’s certificate programs can jump right into the academic field of study that sparks their interest and pick up or refresh the specific STEM skills they need to succeed while earning credits toward their certificate or degree objective, and without the stigma often associated with placement in a remedial track, where they might also be asked to review material or skills they already know.

Many studies have now demonstrated that one of the best ways to keep students, and particularly students at risk of dropping out, engaged is to avoid wasting their time on extraneous, unnecessary or redundant exercises that turn what could be a ladder of opportunity into an obstacle course. The National STEM Bridge Strategy’s use of open educational resources is designed to remove those barriers.

#Opening careers
[end]

These flexible, open, online STEM learning resources and others like them help educators implement other cutting-edge innovations. Some of the colleges participating in the Consortium are, for example, offering new “cohort models,” that guide small groups of students as they work together toward common degree or certificate goals. “If we look at new or dislocated workers, cohort based short term certificate programs provide the technical training and a very high success factor, so that one can move from underemployment or unemployment to fulltime employment,” reports John Gajewski, retired vice president for workforce and economic development at Cuyahoga Community College, a Consortium member in Northeast Ohio.

Community colleges participating in the National STEM Consortium currently offer five, one-year, 30-credit STEM certificate programs in growing industries: composites, cyber technology, electric vehicle technology, environmental technology and mechatronics. The Consortium’s STEM Readiness Course is programmatically consistent across all five fields and fully transferable to other colleges, according to the Consortium’s website. It was designed to help students develop the critical skills identified by instructors and industry subject matter experts in all five programs.  The open educational resources produced by the National STEM Consortium carry a Creative Commons BY license, which permits the use and repurposing of these instructional materials and resources by others entirely free of charge, with attribution to the original creators.
